# Databricks Playground

Welcome to the **Databricks Playground** GitHub project! This repository is a comprehensive collection of various datasets, each carefully curated to demonstrate and explore the power of Databricks in performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

## Project Overview

In the Databricks Playground, you'll find:

1. **Datasets**: A diverse array of datasets from different domains, designed to give you a broad spectrum of data to work with. Each dataset is stored in its own directory, containing raw data files, and any necessary metadata.

2. **ETL Processes**: For each dataset, detailed ETL pipelines are provided. These pipelines transform raw data into clean, structured formats ready for analysis. You'll find scripts and notebooks that showcase best practices in data cleansing, normalization, and transformation using Databricks.

3. **Machine Learning**: For datasets containing a "label" column, a variety of machine learning algorithms are applied to predict outcomes and uncover insights. The repository includes:
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Notebooks that explore the data, visualize distributions, and highlight key features.
    - **Model Training**: Implementation of different machine learning models, including but not limited to:
        - Linear Regression
        - Decision Trees
        - Random Forests
        - Gradient Boosting Machines
        - Neural Networks
    - **Performance Evaluation**: Comparative analysis of model performances using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, etc. Visualizations and reports that help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
